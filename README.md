# <Quiz-Mania>

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project.

My motivation for this project was to build a website to quiz students on their basic knowledge on programming. I built this project to help spread knowledge 
for up and coming software developers, as well as anyone who might just want to learn more about programming. Quiz mania also helps keep track of your progress
by keeping score on all quizzes.
